 <b>Rowan Sebastion Atkinson</b>
 CBE (born 6 January 1955) is an English actor, comedian and writer. He played the title roles in 
 the sitcoms Blackadder (1983–1989) and Mr. Bean (1990–1995), and in the film series Johnny English 
 (2003–2018). Atkinson first came to prominence on the BBC sketch comedy show Not the Nine O'Clock 
 News (1979–1982), receiving the 1981 British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment 
 Performance.
Atkinson has appeared in various films, including the James Bond film Never Say Never Again (1983), 
The Witches (1990), Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), Rat Race (2002), Scooby-Doo (2002),
 Love Actually (2003), and Wonka (2023). He played the voice role of Zazu in the Disney animated film 
 The Lion King (1994). Atkinson portrayed Mr. Bean in the film adaptations Bean (1997) and Mr. Bean's
  Holiday (2007). He also featured on the BBC sitcom The Thin Blue Line (1995–1996) and played the 
  titular character in ITV's Maigret (2016–2017). His work in theatre includes the role of Fagin in
   the 2009 West End revival of the musical Oliver!.
Atkinson was listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest actors in British comedy in 2003,[3] 
and among the top 50 comedians ever, in a 2005 poll of fellow comedians.[4] Throughout his career, 
he has collaborated with screenwriter Richard Curtis and composer Howard Goodall, both of whom he 
met at the Oxford University Dramatic Society during the 1970s. In addition to his 1981 BAFTA, 
Atkinson received an Olivier Award for his 1981 West End theatre performance in Rowan Atkinson in 
Revue. Atkinson was appointed CBE in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.

 Atkinson was born in Consett, County Durham, England, on 6 January 1955.[5][6][7] The youngest of 
 four boys, his parents were Eric Atkinson, a farmer and company director, and Ella May 
 (née Bainbridge), who married on 29 June 1945.[7] His three older brothers are Paul, who died as
  an infant; Rodney, a Eurosceptic economist who narrowly lost the UK Independence Party leadership 
  election in 2000; and Rupert.[8][9]
Atkinson was brought up Anglican,[10] and was educated at the Durham Chorister School, a preparatory
 school, and then at St Bees School. Rodney, Rowan and their older brother Rupert were brought up in
  Consett and went to school with the future Prime Minister, Tony Blair, at Durham Choristers.[11] 
  After receiving top grades in science A levels,[12] he secured a place at Newcastle University, 
  where he received a BSc degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 1975.[13][14] 
  He subsequently obtained an MSc degree in
 Electrical Engineering at The Queen's College, Oxford in 1975, the same college where his father 
 matriculated in 1935,[15] and which made Atkinson an Honorary Fellow in 2006.[16] His master's 
 thesis, published in 1978, considered the application of self-tuning control.[17]
Atkinson briefly embarked on a PhD study before devoting his full attention to acting.[18] First 
winning national attention in The Oxford Revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1976,[13]
 he had already written and performed sketches for shows in Oxford by the Etceteras – the revue group
  of the Experimental Theatre Club (ETC) – and for the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS),
   meeting writer Richard Curtis,[13] and composer Howard Goodall, with whom he would continue to
    collaborate during his career.[19]
